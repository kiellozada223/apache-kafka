This project aims to de-congest the national highways by analyzing the road traffic data from different toll plazas. As a vehicle passes a toll plaza, the vehicle’s data like vehicle_id,vehicle_type,toll_plaza_id and timestamp are streamed to Kafka. 
Create a data pipe line that collects the streaming data and loads it into a database.
